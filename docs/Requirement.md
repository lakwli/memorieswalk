# üìï Minimum-Viable Digital MyMemories Album

## 1. My Memories (Dashboard)

- **List of Memories**

This is the central hub where users first land. I've kept it clean and minimal with:

Simple, prominent upload and create album buttons
Recent photos displayed in an easy-to-scan grid
Quick access to albums
A straightforward search function
User profile access in the top right

The dashboard helps users quickly find their content without overwhelming them with options.
