It is self-hosted photo sharing platform with a focus on creating an intuitive, user-friendly experience for all ages—from teenagers to older adults. 

The web app should allow:
Uploading photos (drag & drop or mobile tap)
Placing them into freeform canvas
Generating a shareable link for others to view


Below are the key screens, highlighting the new canvas feature you requested.

1. **My Canvases (Dashboard)**
2. **Canvas Editor**
3. **Share/Publish**

Here’s the super-simple spec:

# 📕 Minimum-Viable Digital Canvas Album

## 1. My Canvases (Dashboard)

* **List of Canvases**

This is the central hub where users first land. I've kept it clean and minimal with:

Simple, prominent upload and create album buttons
Recent photos displayed in an easy-to-scan grid
Quick access to albums
A straightforward search function
User profile access in the top right

The dashboard helps users quickly find their content without overwhelming them with options.
