# Key Design Principles

### üì± Device Support

| Feature                             | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üíª **Desktop + üì± Mobile Friendly** | Responsive UI for both desktop and touchscreen mobile devices.                |
| üñ±Ô∏è **Mouse + Touch Input**          | Supports drag/drop, zoom/pinch, drawing via mouse or finger.                  |
| üí° **Clean UI**                     | Designed for non-technical users. Buttons labeled clearly with helpful icons. |

Based on the specification document, I'll design screens with these principles in mind:

- **Simplicity**: Clean layouts with clear visual hierarchy
- **Intuitive navigation**: Familiar patterns users already understand
- **Minimal cognitive load**: Focused interfaces that don't overwhelm
- **Accessibility**: Designs that work for users of all ages (teens to elderly)
- **Consistency**: Similar patterns and interactions across screens

# App Vision

A digital canvas-based photo-sharing app designed to emulate the nostalgic experience of physical photo albums, allowing users to present and share personal memories in a creative, customizable, and story-driven format. Open source and hosted per user via subdomain for personalization.

# Out of Scope / Not Included

- ‚ùå AI face detection or tagging
- ‚ùå Search or smart albums
- ‚ùå Complex filters or advanced photo editing
- ‚ùå Social media features (likes, followers, etc.)
