I have resize, and move to another location. but it was not saved.
after save, picture become big and in differnet location.
the loading of dashboard is slow, is it load the whole memory full set? or just the memory title with snapshot?
viewALL doesn't work.
to support photo remove. (to test if temp is removed)

to test:
remove memory : photo, photo link, permanent file should be removed.
test the photo files if deleted (it seems that few rounds )
