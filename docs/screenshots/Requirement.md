Absolutely—if we strip it down to the purest “digital scrapbook” experience, we can remove the Grid view altogether and focus on just:

1. **My Canvases (Dashboard)**
2. **Canvas Editor**
3. **Share/Publish**

Here’s the super-simple spec:

---

# 📕 Minimum-Viable Digital Canvas Album

## 1. My Canvases (Dashboard)

* **List of Canvases**

  * Thumbnail (auto-snapshot of canvas)
  * Title
  * Last edited timestamp
  * Actions: Edit, Share, Delete

* **Create Canvas** button → prompts for a canvas title.

---

## 2. Canvas Editor

### A. Toolbar

| Icon      | Action                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 📁 Upload | Pick or drag-drop photos              |
| ✍️ Text   | Add a text box anywhere               |
| 🖌️ Draw  | Freehand brush (color/width controls) |
| 🔄 Rotate | Rotate selected element               |
| 📑 Layers | Bring forward / send backward         |
| 💾 Save   | Manual save (auto-save always on)     |
| 🔗 Share  | Generate read-only link               |

### B. Workspace

* **Infinite/Scrollable Canvas**
* **Photo Elements**

  * Drop photos anywhere, resize, rotate, layer
* **Text Elements**

  * Click to type, drag/resize, style (font, size, color)
* **Drawing Layer**

  * Scribble arrows, circles, highlights
* **Auto-Save** every few seconds behind the scenes

---

## 3. Share & View

* **Share Link**

  * One click → creates a view-only URL
  * Viewers see the canvas exactly as laid out
* **Privacy**

  * Canvas private until you click “Share”
  * No login required for viewers

---

## 4. Future-Proofing (Optional Later)

* **Multi-Page Support** (if needed)
* **Alternate “Gallery” View** (auto-arranged grid or timeline)
* **Comments or Lightbox** on view mode

---

### 📈 Why This Works

* **Zero friction** for non-tech users: open, upload, drag, doodle, share.
* **One mental model** (Canvas) instead of juggling albums vs. pages vs. grids.
* **Extensible later** if you want grid/timeline or page breaks.

You now have a crystal-clear, focused spec:
**Dashboard → Canvas → Share.** Let me know if you’d like a quick wireframe or code-structure outline to kick things off!
