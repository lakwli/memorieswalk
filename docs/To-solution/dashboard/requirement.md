Act As a professional UI/UX designer,, please design dashboard page more appearance and professional feel. It should have a modern design, be intuitive, and feel good. My app is designed for sharing photos, mimicking the traditional way we organize our physical pictures in an album and share them with others. User can have multiple elbums. For each elbum, user can click on the elbum to go to edit page which will present canvas that user can freely put image into the canvas and draw around it. From dashboard, it should show the elbums that the user have, with the most recently as the order. User can also select favourite elbum. The dashboard should also have the user name on the right corner and have user-related setting (e.g. account setting) menu beside it. Please follow enterprise level design to make the page look professional feel. Please refer to well-known similar app for reference.
