# Designing a Flexible Drawing App Architecture in React + Vite

This document outlines a recommended architecture and design approach for a React-based drawing app supporting multiple element types, grouping, dynamic toolbars, and advanced textbox features such as shape variants.

---

## 1. Core Concepts & Element Modeling

### Elements Overview

Your app contains different element types:

- **Photo**
- **Shape**
- **Sticker**
- **Cursor**
- **Pen**
- **Textbox** (special text element with editable content)
- **Group** (container of elements, can nest)

All elements share common behaviors:

- Move
- Resize
- Rotate
- Bring to Front / Send to Back (Z-index management)
- Delete

### Element Interface Example (TypeScript)

```ts
type ElementType = "photo" | "shape" | "sticker" | "cursor" | "pen" | "textbox" | "group";

interface BaseElement {
  id: string;
  type: ElementType;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  rotation: number;
  zIndex: number;
  selected: boolean;

  // Common actions
  move(dx: number, dy: number): void;
  resize(newWidth: number, newHeight: number): void;
  rotate(angle: number): void;
  bringToFront(): void;
  sendToBack(): void;
  delete(): void;

  getSupportedControls(): ControlType[];
}

interface GroupElement extends BaseElement {
  type: "group";
  children: BaseElement[];
  // Override actions to operate on children collectively
}

interface TextboxElement extends BaseElement {
  type: "textbox";
  text: string;
  fontSize: number;
  fontFamily: string;
  textAlign: "left" | "center" | "right";
  shapeVariant: "rectangle" | "speechBubble" | "cloud" | "roundedRect" | ...;
}
```
````

### Control Types

Define possible controls as strings or enum:

```ts
type ControlType =
  | "move"
  | "resize"
  | "rotate"
  | "bringToFront"
  | "sendToBack"
  | "delete"
  | "textAlign"
  | "fontSize"
  | "fontFamily"
  | "fillColor"
  | ...;
```

## 2. Grouping and Composite Elements

- Groups are composite elements that **contain child elements**.
- Groups support the same common behaviors but operate on their children collectively.
- Groups can be nested.
- Group selection shows a **group toolbar** that consolidates controls applicable to all children.
- Example: A group containing a photo and a pen can be moved, resized, rotated, brought to front/back as a single entity.

---

## 3. Selection and Toolbar Design

- **Selection state** maintains which elements are currently selected.
- Toolbar dynamically shows controls based on the selection:

  - Single element → element-specific controls.
  - Multiple elements or groups → intersection of controls supported by all selected elements.
  - Group toolbar includes controls affecting the group container and common child controls.

- Toolbar components are composable, reactive, and update automatically on selection change.

Example to compute common controls for selection:

```ts
function getCommonControls(elements: BaseElement[]): ControlType[] {
  if (elements.length === 0) return [];
  return elements
    .map((el) => el.getSupportedControls())
    .reduce((common, controls) => common.filter((c) => controls.includes(c)));
}
```

## 4. Textbox Design and Dynamic Shape Variants

### Treat Textbox as a Single Compound Element

- Textbox is not a group of shape + text, but a single element combining text content and a shape.
- This allows specialized text controls like alignment, font, etc.

### Adding Shape Variants to Textbox

Textbox includes a `shapeVariant` property to allow switching the background shape dynamically:

```ts
interface TextboxElement extends BaseElement {
  type: "textbox";
  text: string;
  fontSize: number;
  fontFamily: string;
  textAlign: "left" | "center" | "right";
  shapeVariant: "rectangle" | "speechBubble" | "cloud" | "roundedRect" | ...;
}
```

### Rendering Textbox with Shape Variants

- Render shape background depending on `shapeVariant` (SVG or CSS).
- Render editable text inside shape container.
- Provide toolbar controls to switch shape variants.

Example React snippet:

```tsx
function Textbox({ element, onUpdate }) {
  const { text, shapeVariant, fontSize, fontFamily, textAlign } = element;

  const ShapeBackground = () => {
    switch (shapeVariant) {
      case "speechBubble":
        return <SpeechBubbleSVG />;
      case "cloud":
        return <CloudSVG />;
      default:
        return <RectangleShape />;
    }
  };

  return (
    <div
      className="textbox-wrapper"
      style={
        {
          /* size, position, rotation */
        }
      }
    >
      <ShapeBackground />
      <textarea
        value={text}
        style={{ fontSize, fontFamily, textAlign }}
        onChange={(e) => onUpdate({ ...element, text: e.target.value })}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 5. Recommended React Architecture

- Use a **centralized state store** (React context, Zustand, Redux) to manage elements, groups, and selection.
- Elements are rendered via type-specific React components.
- Groups render recursively, rendering children within.
- Toolbar subscribes to selection and element store, dynamically generating controls.
- Use an action/command pattern for behaviors to enable undo/redo.
- Z-index managed by an explicit `zIndex` property or stacking order.

---

## 6. Insights from Mature Drawing Apps

Apps like Figma, Canva, and Adobe XD apply similar principles:

- All elements are nodes in a scene graph.
- Groups are composite nodes with children.
- Selection system highlights and acts on single or multiple nodes.
- Toolbars dynamically reflect current selection capabilities.
- Textboxes are atomic with specialized text editing features.
- Undo/redo implemented with command stacks.
- Z-index managed for layering elements.

## 7. Summary

| Feature             | Design Approach                                 | Benefits                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Elements            | Base element interface with type-specific props | Unified API, easy to extend |
| Grouping            | Composite element with child elements           | Simplifies batch operations |
| Toolbar             | Dynamic, contextual based on selection          | Intuitive UI                |
| Textbox with shapes | Single element with `shapeVariant` property     | Flexible, scalable, easy UX |

---

## Next Steps

- Implement SVG shapes for speech bubble, cloud, etc.
- Build reusable React components per element type.
- Develop toolbar components that generate controls dynamically.
- Integrate grouping and selection logic with centralized state.
- Add undo/redo support using action pattern.
