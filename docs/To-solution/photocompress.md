Curently:
Upon photo upload, there is no compression or contraint on the photo upload. Upon save, photo will be converted into webp file.

Why compress comes into picture
I use cloudlare free tier. it seems that there is limit of 1mb file upload. in order not impact user experience, the app can auto compress the photo upon upload on client side.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Enable users to upload images that are always **â‰¤ 1MB** before being sent to the server, ensuring:

- Fast compression (client-side).
- Visual quality is preserved as much as possible.
- No unnecessary compression for already small images.
- Compatibility with WebP format (used in your backend).
- Awareness of infrastructure limitations (e.g., Cloudflare limits).

---

## ðŸ”„ Compression Lifecycle Overview

### Step 1: **Initial File Size Check**

- If the image is already **â‰¤ 1MB**, accept it immediately.
- If the image is larger than 1MB, proceed to compression.

> Avoid compressing unnecessarily to save time and preserve image fidelity.

---

### Step 2: **Format and Content Analysis**

- Determine the original format: PNG, JPEG, etc.
- Detect if the image has **transparency** (alpha channel).
- Assess resolution: width and height in pixels.

> This helps determine the best target format and whether resizing is needed.

### Step 3: **Smart Compression Path Selection**

| Condition                       | Action                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PNG with transparency           | Use WebP (lossless or lossy, depending on size); retain transparency. |
| PNG without transparency        | Convert to WebP lossy or JPEG.                                        |
| JPEG or other photo formats     | Convert to WebP lossy.                                                |
| Vector or line-art (e.g. logos) | Use lossless compression (or SVG if possible).                        |

---

### Step 4: **Quality Targeting Based on Size**

Use the original file size to decide how aggressively to compress:

| File Size | Starting Quality |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| â‰¤ 2MB     | 0.8              |
| 2â€“4MB     | 0.7              |
| 4â€“8MB     | 0.6              |
| > 8MB     | 0.5              |

> This avoids wasting time trying high-quality compression on very large files, which wonâ€™t succeed under 1MB.

---

### Step 5: **Progressive Compression Strategy**

- Attempt compression at the starting quality.
- If result > 1MB:

  - Reduce quality in steps (e.g., 0.8 â†’ 0.7 â†’ 0.6â€¦).

- If even lowest acceptable quality (e.g., 0.5) fails:

  - Begin **resizing** the image while maintaining aspect ratio.
  - Downscale gradually (e.g., 4096px â†’ 2048px â†’ 1600px).
  - Repeat compression steps after each downscale.

> Resize only when quality degradation alone is insufficient to hit the size target.

---

### Step 6: **Performance Safeguards**

- Perform compression in **Web Workers** to avoid freezing UI.
- Cap compression to a **reasonable duration** (e.g., show a loading indicator if over 1â€“2 seconds).
- Inform users of progress for large files (e.g., "Compressing...").

---

### Step 7: **Post-Compression Actions**

- Export image in **WebP format**, which balances size and quality well and supports transparency.
- Strip unnecessary metadata (EXIF, GPS, camera info) to save bytes.
- Ensure final file is **â‰¤ 1MB**.
- If it still exceeds the limit:

  - Warn the user and suggest resizing before uploading.

---

### Step 8: **Compatibility and Fallbacks**

- WebP is supported in all modern browsers; fallback only needed for legacy browsers (rare).
- Consider AVIF for future optimization (smaller than WebP, but less supported).
- Backend should validate size as a failsafe, even after client-side compression.

## âœ… Summary: What Youâ€™re Aiming For

- **Compression only when needed**
- **Format-specific strategies** (especially for transparency)
- **Smart quality targeting** based on file size
- **Progressive compression and resizing**, used only when required
- **WebP output** to match your backend format
- **Client-side performance** considerations with Web Workers
- **Awareness of upstream limitations**, like Cloudflareâ€™s 1MB limit
