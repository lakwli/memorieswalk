cursor design has a strong impact on user experience, especially when dealing with draggable elements and canvas interactions. o visually distinguish the two contexts before dragging:
Photo hover: cursor: move
Empty space hover: cursor: grab
Dragging (either): cursor: grabbing
This lets users instantly tell what will happen — move object vs. pan canvas — with zero confusion. Want help coding the cursor logic?
