Key Architectural Recommendations

1. Tool Management Abstraction
   Currently, tool logic is scattered in the main component. Consider a useToolManager hook that:

Encapsulates tool state and switching logic
Handles tool-specific cursor management
Manages tool-specific event handlers
Provides consistent tool activation/deactivation patterns 2. Event Handler Delegation
The stage event handlers (click, drag, etc.) will become complex with more element types. Consider:

A centralized event dispatcher that routes events to appropriate tool handlers
Tool-specific event handler registration system
Clear separation between canvas navigation events and element creation events 3. UI Component Composition
The EditorControls component will grow significantly. Structure it as:

Toolbar sections: Group related tools (drawing, text, media, navigation)
Tool-specific panels: Expandable panels for complex tools (pen settings, text formatting)
Context-sensitive controls: Show/hide based on selected element type 4. Element-Specific Behaviors
Your current approach is good, but prepare for:

Tool-specific creation flows: Some elements may need multi-step creation (e.g., drawing paths for pen)
Element property panels: Right-side panels for detailed element configuration
Element interaction modes: Different elements may have different selection/manipulation behaviors 5. State Organization Strategy
Consider grouping related state:

6. Configuration-Driven Approach
   For scalability, consider:

Tool registry: Define tools declaratively with their behaviors, icons, and handlers
Element type configurations: Centralized definitions of element capabilities
Keyboard shortcut mapping: Configurable key bindings for tools
Practical Implementation Priorities
Phase 1: Tool Management
Extract tool management logic into a dedicated hook
Create a tool registry system for easier addition of new tools
Implement consistent tool activation patterns
Phase 2: UI Modularity
Break down EditorControls into composable toolbar sections
Create reusable property panel components
Implement context-sensitive UI showing
Phase 3: Advanced Element Support
Enhance the element behavior system for complex interactions
Add support for multi-step element creation workflows
Implement element-specific property management
Key Benefits of This Approach
Incremental complexity: Add features without major rewrites
Clear boundaries: Each concern has its dedicated space
Easy debugging: Issues are localized to specific domains
Developer experience: New developers can quickly understand the tool/element/UI separation
Extensibility: New elements require minimal changes to core logic
What NOT to Do
Don't over-abstract initially - start with concrete implementations and extract patterns
Don't break every small piece into separate files - maintain logical groupings
Don't optimize for theoretical use cases - focus on the immediate next 2-3 element types
This approach balances architectural soundness with practical development needs, allowing your team to add new elements efficiently while maintaining code clarity.
