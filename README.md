# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Initial Setup

The application comes with a default administrator account:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

**Important:** For security reasons, please change the admin password immediately after first login.

To initialize the default admin user:

```bash
npm run seed-admin
```
